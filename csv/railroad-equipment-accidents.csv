AS A RESULT, DAMAGE TO LIRR PROPERTY WAS SUSTAINED AT THE STATION. 

THE CAR WAS THE 26TH CAR IN A 41 CARCONSIST. THE CREW WAS UNAWARE OF ANY OF ANY IMPACT OR EVENT PRIOR TO BEING INSTRUCTED BY LIRR TO STOP THEIR TRAIN AND INSPECT THE CONSIST DUE TO THE STATION PLATFORM STRIKE AT WYANDANCH.

THE ENGINEER AND CREW PERFORMED AN INITIAL TERMINAL BRAKE TEST PRIOR TO DEPARTURE FROM THE POINT OF ORIGIN. DURING THE INSPECT OF BOTH SIDES OF THE CONSIST NEITHER THE CONDUCTOR NOR THE BRAKEMAN TOOK ANY EXCEPTION TO THE TRAIN AND BOTH CREWMEMBERS FAILED TO NOTICE THAT THE PLUG DOOR WAS NOT SECURELY CLOSED AND THAT THE TRAIN WAS NOT SAFE TO MOVE.

THE CAR IN QUESTION HAD BEEN MOVED FROM THE CUSTOMER SIDING THE PRIOR NIGHT AND HAD BEEN MOVED SAFELY FROM HOLTSVILLE TO PINEAIRE. IT APPEARS THAT THE DOOR MAY HAVE BEEN TAMPERED WITH AND OPENED BY TRESSPASSERS DURING THE 18 HOURS THAT THE CAR SAT IN THE PILGRIM SPUR SIDING AT PINE AIRE. THIS LOCATION IS VERY ACCESSIBLE FROM THE ADJACENT PARKING LOT. AFTERINSPECTION OF THAT AREA, THERE WAS EVIDENCE THAT TRESPASSERS HAD BEEN IN THE AREA RECENTLY.

THE INCIDENT WAS NOT PREVIOUSLY REPORTED BY THE NYA AS AN FRA REPORTABLE ACCIDENT/INCIDENT BECAUSE THE INITIAL ASSESSMENT IN THE FIELD BY NYA MANAGEMENT INDICATED THAT THERE WAS NO DAMAGE TO THE TRACK STRUCTURE, SAVE FOR A SHORT SEGMENT OF FIBERGLASS THIRD RAIL PROTECTION BOARD. TRACK REPAIRS WERE INITIALLY ESTIMATED AT APPROXIMATELY $2,800. REPAIRS TO THE CAR WERE ESTIMATED TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY UNDER THE REPORTING THRESHOLD.

THE LIRR ESTIMATED DAMAGES AT $13,654 WHICHARE DISPUTED BY NYA AS BEING MUCH GREATER THAN THE 'IN-KIND' REPLACEMENT COSTS FOR THE DAMAGE INCURRED AS NO WHEELS LEFT THE RUNNING RAILS AND THE TRACK BED SUFFERED NO DAMAGE. 

LIRR FINALIZED ITSTRACK DAMAGE AT $10,756. THE NYA ASSERTS THAT THIS COST IS TOO LARGE FOR THE DAMAGE TO THE THIRD RAIL PROTECTION BOARD AND MAY ALSO INCLUDE CLEARING COSTS.
